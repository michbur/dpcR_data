# Usage of the data sets

## Download

The data can be downloaded here on [github](https://github.com/michbur/dpcReport_data/archive/master.zip) as a zip-file, so that the download is as open and simple as possible. [However, this data repository can be used as any github repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Download and read into R

All data sets can be downloaded using the following code:

```
download.file(url = "https://github.com/michbur/dpcReport_data/archive/master.zip", 
              destfile = "dpcReport_data.zip")
unzip("dpcReport_data.zip", exdir = getwd())
file.remove("dpcReport_data.zip")
# read a chosen file using dpcR package
library(dpcR)
read_dpcr(input = "dpcR_data-master/QX200.csv", format = "QX200")
```

# Software package for the data analysis

The data can be used from the web server [dpcReport](http://www.smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/shiny/dpcReport/) GUI or from the command line via the [dpcR](https://github.com/michbur/dpcR) R package.
